Create ipynb that perform the following steps:
Step 1: Load the AmesHousing.csv using pandas 
Step 2: Perform EDA:
    - Check for missing values
    - Perform imputation if there is missing values
    - Split into categorical and continuous variables and do the EDA
    - Based on EDA, apply feature selections or regularization using LASSO, and make it as input ready for next Step
    - Save all the plots in png folder
Step 3: Supervised Machine Learning
    - Split into 80-20 for training testing
    - Apply K-fold cross validation (5-fold) 
    - Using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Trees
    - Use SalePrice as target and feature selection as input from previous Step 2
    - Shortlist important features after modeling
Step 4: Create report documents in Latex format having 4 chapters:
    - Chapter 1: Introduction
    - Chapter 2: EDA and put all plots from png folder into this chapters
    - Chapter 3: Modeling part: write detailed description about the modeling using Random Forest and GBT
    - Chapter 4: Discussions and Conclusions
    - Save all Latex files in report folder
